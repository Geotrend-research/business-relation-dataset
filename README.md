# BizRel: Business Relation Dataset

BizRel is a business relation dataset composed of 10k instances in **english** and another 10k instances in **french**. It has been compiled to train relation extraction models at the sentence level. Each relation instance is a tuple **(Sentence, entity1, entity2, relation_type)**, where: 
1. **entity1** and **entity2** are named entities of type **Organization (ORG)**. 
2. **sentences** are raw sentences collected from the web.
3. **relation_types** are relation labels manually annotated by crowdsourcing (using the [Isahit](https://isahit.com/) platform).   

A part of this dataset can be used for research purposes. Commercial use is not allowed as well as third party distribution.
